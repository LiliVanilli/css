# Task 2: Time Series Feature Extraction with EdgeML

Data analysis task using EdgeML Python library to download sensor datasets and extract statistical features using sliding windows.

## Overview

This task demonstrates:
1. Downloading sensor data from EdgeML using the Python API
2. Creating sliding windows over time series data
3. Extracting statistical features (mean, variance) from windows
4. Preparing data for further analysis or machine learning

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (or use https://bwjupyter.de)
- EdgeML Python library
- Pandas for data manipulation

## Installation

```bash
cd task2

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter Notebook (if running locally)
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter and follow the step-by-step analysis.
